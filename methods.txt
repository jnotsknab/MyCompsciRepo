String methods: Python has a variety of methods to manipulate and work with strings. Some common string methods include:

strip(): Remove leading and trailing white spaces.


split(): Split a string into a list of substrings.

join(): Join a list of strings into a single string.

replace(): Replace occurrences of a substring with another substring.

upper(), lower(): Convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.

startswith(), endswith(): Check if a string starts or ends with a specified substring.

List methods: Python provides several methods to manipulate lists:



append(): Add an element to the end of a list.

extend(): Append elements from another list or iterable to a list.

insert(): Insert an element at a specified position in a list.

remove(): Remove the first occurrence of an element from a list.

pop(): Remove and return an element at a specified position in a list.

sort(): Sort a list in ascending or descending order.

reverse(): Reverse the order of elements in a list.

Dictionary methods: Python offers methods to work with dictionaries:



get(): Retrieve the value associated with a key or return a default value if the key is not found.

keys(): Return a view of the dictionary's keys.

values(): Return a view of the dictionary's values.

items(): Return a view of the dictionary's key-value pairs.

update(): Update the dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or iterable.

pop(): Remove and return the value associated with a key or return a default value if the key is not found.

popitem(): Remove and return an arbitrary key-value pair from the dictionary.

Set methods: Python provides methods to work with sets:



add(): Add an element to a set.

update(): Add multiple elements from an iterable to a set.

remove(): Remove an element from a set, raising a KeyError if the element is not found.

discard(): Remove an element from a set if it is present.

pop(): Remove and return an arbitrary element from the set.

union(), intersection(), difference(), symmetric_difference(): Perform set operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

File handling methods: Python has built-in methods for working with files:



open(): Open a file for reading, writing, or appending.

read(): Read the entire content of a file.

readline(): Read a single line from a file.

readlines(): Read all lines from a file and return them as a list.

write(): Write a string to a file.


writelines(): Write a list of strings to a file.

close(): Close an open file.

Object-oriented methods: Python supports object-oriented programming, and classes can have special methods:



__init__(): The constructor method, called when an object is created.

__str__(): A string representation of an object, called by the str() built-in function and the
