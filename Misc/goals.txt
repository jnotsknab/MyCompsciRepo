The script provided above requires an intermediate level of Python programming knowledge. An intermediate Python programmer should have a solid understanding of fundamental Python concepts and be comfortable working with libraries and APIs. They should also have experience with file handling, error handling, and basic data manipulation.

To create and modify the script above, a programmer should be familiar with:

Python basics: variables, loops, functions, and conditional statements.
File handling: opening, reading, writing, and closing files, as well as working with file paths.
Working with third-party libraries: installing and using libraries such as requests, Pillow, and google-api-python-client.
Image processing: using the PIL (Pillow) library for basic image manipulation tasks, such as resizing images.
Web requests: using the requests library to download files from the internet.
Sending emails: understanding the basics of the email protocol (SMTP) and using Google API client libraries to send emails through Gmail.
Error handling: using try-except blocks to handle potential errors and exceptions gracefully.
A beginner Python programmer might find the script challenging but can still learn from it by breaking down each section and understanding the purpose of each function and library used. On the other hand, an advanced Python programmer might be able to optimize the script further or add more complex automation tasks.

if i am a first year computer science student in college and I just finished learning the basics of classes and objects along with functions and I am able to write a script that creates a to do list in the terminal then what is a good estimate of how long I would need to practice in order to write a script like this one
As a first-year computer science student who has just finished learning the basics of classes, objects, and functions, you already have a good foundation to build upon. The time it takes to reach the level required to write a script like the one provided depends on several factors, such as your learning style, prior experience, available time for practice, and your ability to grasp new concepts.

A rough estimate would be anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months of consistent practice and learning to get comfortable with the required skills. Here are some suggestions on what to focus on:

File handling: Familiarize yourself with reading, writing, and manipulating files and directories in Python. This is a key skill for many automation tasks.

Libraries and APIs: Learn how to work with third-party libraries and APIs, as they can significantly extend the functionality of your scripts. Start with the ones used in the example script (requests, Pillow, and google-api-python-client) and explore others as needed.

Error handling: Understand how to handle errors and exceptions in your code using try-except blocks. This will help you write more robust and reliable scripts.

Work on small projects: Start by writing small scripts that automate simple tasks or solve specific problems. This will give you hands-on experience and improve your problem-solving skills.

Read and analyze code: Look at examples of more complex Python scripts and try to understand how they work. This will help you learn new techniques and best practices.

Seek help and collaborate: Join online forums, coding communities, or work with classmates to learn from others and get feedback on your code.

Practice regularly: Like any skill, programming improves with consistent practice. Set aside dedicated time to work on your programming skills, and try to learn something new every day.

Remember that learning to program is a journey, and everyone progresses at their own pace. Keep learning, practicing, and challenging yourself, and you'll be able to write scripts like the one provided in no time.
